Status : Draft / WIP

My simple webgl wrapper (utils, micro frameworks, notes...) in [dart](http://dartlang.org)
Demos :
* a [Micro shader edit/viewer](http://davidb.github.io/glf/), the demo use a pseudo deferred rendering pipeline (source in the web directory)

IMPORTANT NOTICE:

* This lib is still under development. Any changes will be done without prior notice to consumers of this package.
* If you search for a full featured webgl framework, take a loot at [spectre](https://github.com/johnmccutchan/spectre) but today (2013-08) it doesn't run via dart2js (=> 100% failed on Firefox and partial failure on Chrome)
